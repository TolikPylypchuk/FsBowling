# FsBowling

An app which calculates a bowling score, written in F#.

This is a very simple app, developed for self-education.
It is written in a purely functional style (using lots of monads).
Some of the code may be artificially made too complex for its use
case, but the whole point was to learn about pure functional
constructs, so I tried to cram as many of them as possible here.
